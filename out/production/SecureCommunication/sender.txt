You need to implement a program for each role (i.e., sender and receiver). You don’t need to
include actual socket programming in your code. You can just use local files as the channel to
simulate the communication in the network. For example, to implement requirement 1 above, we
let each party locally generate a key pair and save each key in a corresponding file. The other
party will be able to know the public key by accessing the file. You can create a file called
“Transmitted_Data”, which can include all data transmitted between sender and receiver, i.e.,
encrypted message, encrypted AES key, and the MAC. This file is written by the sender and read
by the receiver.
